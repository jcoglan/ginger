# numbers

The entries with type 'y' often have a definition of the form 'X = ju Y jre'.
They can be arranged into a sequence where each definition refers to the one
before it:

ysi   = ju yre yre
yamte = ju ysi yre
yer   = ju yamte yre
ysx   = ju yer yre
ycx   = ju ysx yre
yux   = ju ycx yre
yax   = ju yux yre
yex   = ju yax yre

This chain of definitions where each one applies the same construction to the
one before it strongly suggests these are a sequence of things, and there being
10 items in this category suggests they're numbers.

The construction 'ju X yre' means 'add 1 to X'. The repetition of 'yre' in 'ju
yre yre' suggests that 'yre' means 'one' and 'ju' (hh) means 'add' or 'plus'.

'yh' is defined as 'tta yre'. By elimination this is most likely 'zero' and so
'tta' (e) could mean 'less than' or 'absence of'.

Note that numbers 1, 2 and 3 have definitions for other types: 'yre' (a), 'ysi'
(a), and 'yamte' (sj). 'One' could also mean 'a' (indefinite article) and 'two'
could mean 'both'.
