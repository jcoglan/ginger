# front matter

The title page bears the text 'GINGER / KEVIN DU', which reads like a title and
author. 'ginger', 'kevin' and 'du' are all words in the language; they could
literally mean 'ginger' and Kevin Du, but let's not assume. 'ginger' and 'kevin'
are 'sj' (nouns) and 'du' is a 'hh'.

The first text in the book after the apparent title and author is:

    LIZU KTAP
    DUDI. SAOLED
    CXQKU. ZUOGU

These are defined as:

    lizu [1, hh] = yra zuf xyt.
    ktap [24, sj] = vh wux kytu f sjlup. asre kevin kytu f deda.
    ktap [24, k] = ja ukaji el je akydep.

    dudi [3, sj] = yre axuaxf kazuqr. suja je ulilu f vh yra. yamte kakakaw yra je aiqr.
    saoled [0, sj] = yre taguqr. dudi kabu.

    cxqku [1, sj] = yre axuaxf kazuqr. hatel kadu.
    zuogu [1, sj] = yre taguqr. hatel kadu.

'lizu ktap' is listed as the game's publisher on Steam, and links to Kevin Du's
page; https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/kevindu. I'm not sure that means
'lizu ktap' means 'Kevin Du' though since only 'ktap' is a 'sj' (noun) or 'k'
(verb). It appears again in 'vh steam lizu ktap ppt', having the form '<r> <sj>
lizu ktap <k>'. It is possible that 'steam' literally means Steam, and the verb
'ppt' means 'publish'. 'vh' would then be a preposition like 'on' or 'in' or
'to' or 'by'. 'r' is a word type with only 13 instances.

A few commonalities appear here in the other definitions:

- Both 'dudi' and 'cxqku' are partly defined as 'yre axuaxf kazuqr'.
- Both 'saoled' and 'zuogu' are partly defined as 'yre taguqr'.
- Both 'cxqku' and 'zuogu' are partly defined as 'hatel kadu'.
- 'saoled' references 'dudi' in its definition via 'dudi kabu'.

All these terms are 'sj' (nouns), so if 'yre' means 'a', then 'dudi' and 'cxqku'
are instances of the same type of thing, ditto for 'saoled' and 'zuogu'.

'dudi' and 'cxqku' appear together again in the phrase 'vh cxqku ee dudi kytu'.
This is followed by:

    yre yh yre botvi cxhht. dudi. DD4 6JE

This is an address; 'yre yh yre' is 101, and DD4 6JE is a postcode in Dundee,
Scotland. It is the address of the Craigtay Hotel, 101 Broughty Ferry Road
(Kevin has confirmed this). It's reasonable to assume that 'dudi' means Dundee
and therefore 'kazuqr' means town/city. 'botvi' and 'cxhht' are both nouns;
either could mean street or road. 'axuaxf' in 'axuaxf kazuqr' could be an
adjective; it has type 'e' and 'e' is a very numerous type, so 'e' could be
'adjective'.

The above commonalities, the relation of 'saoled' to 'dudi' by a single verb,
and the phrasing of 'DUDI. SAOLED' and 'CXQKU. ZUOGU' suggests to me that
'saoled' and 'zuogu' are countries, or at least something larger than a city,
like a county, state or province. If country, that would make 'saoled' Scotland,
and 'kadu' would mean 'contain'. 'saoled' is not used anywhere else, but 'zuogu'
is:

    zuax [1, sj] = zuogu aiqr f liaax z utu lela.

We also see 'taguqr' and 'kazuqr' related by definition:

    taguqr [5, sj] = uxaux kazuqr kadu f uxauxf sjlup. siuai jaraq vh yra ginger
    dkdg. yre geib yra dkdg.

We also see one other town/city is defined; note 'uxauxf' rather than 'axuaxf':

    sjamhe [1, sj] = yre uxauxf kazuqr. vt yra uzuini ji.

We do not yet know what 'hatel' means but its definition has an interesting
repeating clause:

    hatel [3, sj] = gerg z (je bebak f sjlup). aosiple subteta (je bebak f sjlup).

'kadu' and 'kabu' are somehow related:

    kabu [3, k] = yra sjlup yra invh kadu.
    kadu [55, k] = vh yra ji.

We've also seen some uses of words related to others via 'kap', e.g. 'axuaxf',
'uxaux'/'uxauxf', 'invh'.
